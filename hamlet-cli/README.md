# Hamlet CLI

The hamlet cli provides a python based implementation of a hamlet executor. The executor is responsible for interacting with th hamlet engine to generate and execute the deployment documents generated by the engine.

To see the available commands install the package and run

```sh
hamlet --help
```

## Dependencies

Hamlet cli requires the hamlet engine to be installed. See the [install guide](https://hamlet.io/docs/developer-guides/source) on setting this up yourself or use our [docker images](https://hamlet.io/docs/developer-guides/container-tags) which come with the hamlet cli already installed.

At the moment hamlet cli wraps the bash based scripts provided by the [bash executor](https://github.com/hamlet-io/executor-bash) and cannot run independently.
